      <p>My name is Humberto Martin-Son, raised by Leticia,
        brother and mentor to four brothers, friend to Blondie, best friend to Noble.
      </p>
      <p>
        With naught be the intial education of my first 18 years of life, 
        I have been a preparer of sustanance, builder of boxes of cardboard, and master of the markets
        of the telephone. I have been the shipper of the bottles of the plastic, the cleaner of the floors
        of the Lands of Magic, Adventure, Fantasy, Frontier, and Tomorrow! Cleaner of the stalls, mopper of the white tiles!
      </p>
      <p>
        I became a holder of the keys, writer of the buttons, cartaker of the passes of the disabled.
        Every complaint and every compliment was entrusted to me and my kin for safekeeping. I learned to be at the beck and call of our patrons.
        I was in a state of happiness, as I was at the happiest place on earth. Then, I left.
      </p>
      <p>
        I needed to move on from perpetual bliss, as I knew it was unnatural to be happy without ceasing. It became, torture.
        It's a small world after all... It's a small world after all... It's a small world after all... It... became to small to bear...
        I barely escaped alive. No one dares leave without consent of he who wears the blue hat, the red robes... with the big ears,
        and the pointed nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then, I was rewarded for my stint in the land of magic. I was given wings, wings to soar up to 35 thousand feet in the air...
        to serve cocktails, snacks, beverages, and meals to about 250 pairs of other feet. I witnessed those on their way to paradise, to sorrow,
        to excitement, and dread. It was fufilling for a time, to be safeguarding aircraft and patrons in the skies. An experience granting me
        untold adventures, mountains, seas, rivers, and lakes. There were drinks, food, music, and dancing you can only imagine! But alas,
        a human was not designed to stay in the clouds indefintely.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait, a new hope? A shining new goal? A way to progress my goals and my dreams? It was the answer to my inner thoughts throughout the night as I
        sat with my knees to my chest and rocked slowly back and forth! Code Fellows has come!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I shall use my life experiences and these new building blocks of the future to create new aspiration! New inspiration! A new hope for all to see and admire!
        A new game? A website full of awe inspiring pictures? Wonderful national parks and nature? I cannot wait to find out myself.
